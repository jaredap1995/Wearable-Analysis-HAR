# Wearable-Analysis-HAR
Analyzing accelerometer data to develop a workflow to assign labels to unlabeled activity data collected 

This file contains a few of my first HAR classification models developed with Keras, mainly CNNs and LSTMs using the publicly available WISDM dataset as well as a couple activity recognitions on privately held data and a workflow for synthetic data generation that helped me with testing model efficacy.
